# Prefabs

This folder is a Unity conventional folder designated for storing Prefabs. Prefabs in Unity are pre-configured templates of game objects that can be reused across the game. They are a powerful feature that allows developers to design, configure, and store a game object with all its components, properties, and child objects as a single asset.

Prefabs serve multiple purposes:
- **Reusability**: Once a prefab is created, it can be instantiated multiple times across the game scenes, reducing the need to recreate complex object setups.
- **Consistency**: Using prefabs ensures that every instance of the prefab remains consistent across the game. Any changes made to the prefab are automatically reflected in all instances of the prefab.
- **Efficiency**: Prefabs can significantly speed up the game development process. They allow for quick prototyping and iterative design by enabling developers to create and modify complex objects without starting from scratch each time.

To create a prefab, simply drag a configured game object from the scene hierarchy into this folder. This will create a prefab asset that can be instantiated in any scene. Modifications to the prefab can be made by opening the prefab asset and editing its properties directly, or by overriding specific properties in individual instances without affecting the prefab asset itself.

Unity's prefab system also supports nesting, allowing prefabs to contain other prefabs. This feature is particularly useful for creating complex hierarchical structures while maintaining the ability to edit individual components.

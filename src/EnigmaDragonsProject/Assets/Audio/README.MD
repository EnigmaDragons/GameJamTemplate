# Audio Assets

This folder is designated for storing audio assets used within the Unity project. Audio assets include music tracks, sound effects, voiceovers, and any other auditory elements that are implemented in the game. These assets are crucial for creating an immersive and engaging game experience.

Audio assets in Unity can be used for:
- **Background Music**: Enhance the game's atmosphere with music that fits the theme and mood of different game levels or scenes.
- **Sound Effects**: Add realism and feedback to player actions and game events with appropriate sound effects.
- **Voiceovers**: Provide narrative depth and character development through voice-acted lines or narration.

To add an audio asset to your project, you can import it as an audio file (e.g., .mp3, .wav) into this folder. Unity supports a wide range of audio formats, but it's important to consider the quality and file size of your audio to ensure optimal performance.

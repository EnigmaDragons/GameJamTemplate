# Core Library

This folder is designated for storing core Enigma Dragons library files used within the Unity project. The core library consists of essential scripts, utilities, and components that provide foundational functionality across the game. While this library can be utilized throughout the development process, it is generally not expanded upon during a game jam due to time constraints.

The core library may include:
- **Common Utilities**: Reusable code snippets and functions that can be utilized across different parts of the project.
- **Base Components**: Fundamental components that provide basic game functionality, such as movement, input handling, or state management.
- **Helper Scripts**: Scripts that assist in common tasks or streamline development workflows.

Given the time-limited nature of game jams, the core library serves as a stable base from which rapid prototyping and development can occur. It is advisable to have a well-organized and documented core library before entering a game jam to maximize development efficiency.

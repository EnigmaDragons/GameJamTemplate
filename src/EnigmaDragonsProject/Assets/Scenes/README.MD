# Scenes

This folder contains all the scenes used in the game. 

The final build lives in `/Final-DontTOUCH/` and that folder SHALL ONLY be touched by the Unity Integrators.

When you are working on a feature or scene, create your own subfolder with your name, and create and work on all your scenes in that subfolder.
